      <description>There are numerous tools that allow you to extract the macros from a word document without opening it but since those tools don&amp;rsquo;t exist on this box we will have to open up the document with macros disabled (the default on this box)
Upon opening the document we get a warning that the document has macros and they have been disabled (whew)
To view the macros we need to os to tools &amp;gt; macros &amp;gt; edit macros</description>

      <description>While doing an apt update on my Pop_OS! laptop I received the following message
Looking into it I discovered that the gpg key used to sign the updates as trusted was stored in the trusted.gpg store and has been deprecated, so we need to move the gpg key from /etc/apt/trusted.gpg to /usr/share/keyrings/APPKEY.gpg to do this we need to run
sudo apt-key list This will give you a list of your keys we are looking for the key in the /etc/apt/trusted.</description>

      <title>Updating your password policy to force passphrases</title>

      <description>I have recently begun looking at some of the security policies in orgs especially pertaining to passwords. I noticed that typically passwords have to be at least 8 characters and contain a mix of upper and lowercase, numbers, and special chars, but all of those are not required in all environments. In addition to that passwords are set to expire every 3 months. Some environments take this a step further and will remember your last X amount of passwords, this prevents you from using the same few passwords on a cycle.</description>

      <description>My current personal laptop is a 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 SOC as a result of that choice I do have some limitations or rather some challenges to overcome. One of those being the need to run x86 based applications, this is not of concern as far as Windows goes I can just VPN to my home network and use my Desktop for task requiring x86 based code. However for Linux distros specifically in case Kali Linux, remote desktop or RDP takes a little more to get up and running.</description>
