My name is Brandon Taylor and I am a Cybersecurity Professional. Like most typical nerds, I grew up having a curiosity for how things worked and would spend time taking things apart and putting them back together to understand how it truly worked. I have had a love for technology since a young age and spend a lot of my free time exploring and learning various things in the tech world. I like to spend time playing CTFs, including TryHackMe and Hack The Box. This makes for a serious passion for Cybersecurity since understanding how things work fundamentally gives you a great insight into how to secure it or take advantage of a flaw.

My aim with this site is to share my thoughts, tips, tricks and document things I learn or am curious about, so others may find clarity in them or find inspiration to go out and take it even further.
